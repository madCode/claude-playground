/**
 * Holds what is on screen across Activity recreation.

 * The first version kept this in an Activity field, which was fine while
 * the read was synchronous -- the real state was computed in onResume,
 * before the first frame. Making the read asynchronous broke that: every
 * rotation, font-size change, multi-window resize or process death
 * recreated the Activity and drew "Reading" over a sheet that had been
 * there a moment earlier, for as long as a sync-blocked folder took to
 * answer. That is the one thing the app must not do.
 *
 * It also holds the Application rather than the Activity, so an abandoned
 * read cannot keep a destroyed Activity alive.
